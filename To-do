To-do:

-  Figure out how to represent negative binary values
   - pos and neg subclass of Multi?
- Enable multidmux (currently can only accept a one-bit input)?
-  Take out unnecessary functions (comparisons?)
-  Find a better way to test equality in test.py, rather than having str(Multi) all over the place
-  Better formula for full_adder?
-  Collapse full and half adders into one function?
-  Make Multi instances index from the right?
   - Does halfadder need to index from the right
-  Define multimux_multiway as a reduce function?
- Create a truncate function that chops off the extra zeroes on the left?
- Why can't Multi[i] == (1 or True) evaluate correctly?  (in to_decimel)
