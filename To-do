To-do:

-  Find a better way to represent negative binary values?
- Enable multidmux (currently can only accept a one-bit input)?
-  Find a better way to test equality in test.py, rather than having str(Multi) all over the place
-  Better formula for full_adder?
-  Collapse full and half adders into one function?
-  Make Multi instances index from the right?
   - Does halfadder need to index from the right
-  Define multimux_multiway as a reduce function?
- Create a truncate function that chops off the extra zeroes on the left?
- Enable flag in to_decimal for number of digits
- Overload + operator instead of add_multi
- Build RAM more efficiently, abstract a little more, instead of just following the same process over and over again
