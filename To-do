To-do:

1. Figure out how to represent negative binary values
   - pos and neg subclass of Multi?
2. Enable multidmux (currently can only accept a one-bit input)?
3. Take out unnecessary functions (comparisons?)
4. Find a better way to test equality in test.py, rather than having str(Multi) all over the place
5. Better formula for full_adder?
6. Collapse full and half adders into one function?
